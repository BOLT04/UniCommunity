A project idea for our Final Year Project (Projeto e Semin√°rio) 

## Commit message standards

We are trying to use the [Angular standards](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines) as a guideline in most commits. Since the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/) specification is something new to us this is **not a strict rule** that we must follow, just something that helps when writting some commit messages.
